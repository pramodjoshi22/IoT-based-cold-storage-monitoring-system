## Objective

The objective of this Cold Storage Monitoring System report is to comprehensively analyze, evaluate, and present the performance, efficiency, and functionality of the implemented cold storage monitoring solution. This report aims to provide insights into the system's ability to maintain optimal temperature conditions, ensure the integrity of stored goods, and enhance overall operational reliability. Additionally, it seeks to assess the system's capacity to generate real-time alerts, facilitate remote monitoring, and contribute to energy efficiency in cold storage facilities. The findings and recommendations presented in this report will serve as a valuable resource for stakeholders, decision-makers, and technical teams involved in cold storage management, guiding them towards informed decisions, improvements, and optimizations for an effective and robust cold storage monitoring system.

## Components Required:
    1.	Arduino UNO R3
    2.	NodeMCU ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module
    3.	Resistors (1k ohm*2, 220 ohm*1)
    4.	16*2 LCD I2C Display
    5.	DHT-11 Sensor (Temperature and Humidity)
    6.	Ch4 Sensor (MQ-3 Gas Sensor)
    7.	Light Sensor (LDR)

## Sensor & Modules used in this project:

ðŸ“Œ*MQ-3 Sensor:*  The MQ3 sensor is used in food spoilage detectors to detect the emission of ethanol-type gases. When food or fruits spoil, they emit ethanol-type gases. The MQ3 sensor detects the concentration of these gases and outputs an analog voltage that is proportional to the gas concentration.

ðŸ“Œ*LDR:* A Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) is a type of passive electronic sensor used to detect light. It's made up of two conductors separated by an insulator which becomes more conducting when exposed to high levels of light intensity, forming a variable resistor in the circuit.

ðŸ“Œ*DHT-11 Sensor:* The DHT-11 Digital Temperature and Humidity Sensor is a low-cost sensor that can detect moisture and ambient air temperature. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air. The DHT11 can measure temperature in the range of 0Â°C to 50Â°C (32Â°F to 122Â°F) with an accuracy of Â±2Â°C.

ðŸ“Œ*NodeMCU:* The NodeMCU (Node MicroController Unit) is an open-source software and hardware development environment built around an inexpensive System-on-a-Chip (SoC) called the ESP8266. The ESP8266, designed and manufactured by Espressif Systems, contains the crucial elements of a computer: CPU, RAM, networking (WiFi), and even a modern operating system and SDK. That makes it an excellent choice for Internet of Things (IoT) projects of all kinds.
